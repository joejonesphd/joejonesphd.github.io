Why we need to show measures of variability in the media.

Be sure to check out [Part I](https://josephjonesphd.com/Variability1/) first. 

Referring back to variability and the substantive significance, the two-point difference between districts for TestX has more substantive significance than the 20-point difference for TestZ. This was a result of the variability of the different tests. In comparing the districts with TestX, District 2 would have 98% of their scores between 19 and 21 (the mean ± two times the standard deviation) while District 1 would have 98% of their scores between 21 and 23. Here, we have the top 1% of scores in District 2 overlapping with the bottom 1% of scores from District 1. In this case, there is a drastic difference in performance between the two districts and lends a high amount of substantive significance to the two-point difference. 

On the other hand, the increased variability in TestZ from above actually decreases the substantive significance for the 20-point difference. With a standard deviation of 80 for TestZ, we can expect that 98% of District 2 scores would be between 40 and 360. For District 1, we expect that 98% of the scores to between 60 and 380. For TestY, we now have the top 93% of District 2 overlapping with the bottom 93% of District 1. As one can easily tell at this point, there is considerable overlap between the two districts and the 20-point difference now has little substantive value.

However, I think it can be even easier to report SDs and a lay-person with no experience in Statistics can understand what is going on. 

## Show Pictures

Instead of going through the explanation above about the substantive differences between the two districts, just show the below pictures.

Here is the faceted distributions for TestX:

As you can see, there is very little overlap between the two Districts. 

Here is the faceted distributions for TestZ:

Evidence here shows that even though there is a 20 point difference between the two districts, there is still considerable overlap. 

This will be continued in [Part III](https://josephjonesphd.com/Variability3/)
