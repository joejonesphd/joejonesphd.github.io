This is a short test for post on the website

## Does this work? 
-----

I am typing here in R to see if things happen the way I want them to. I am also using this as my markdown cheetsheat. Feel free to look into the file repository for this post and use it as well.

# H1 - is the title
## H2 - is a subheading
### H3 - is a black subheading
#### H4 - Test 4
##### H5 - Test 5
###### H6 - Test 6

Alternative Headers for H1 and H2 can be done with subline underlines

H1 - Alt Method
===============
H2 - Alt Method
---------------

H2 - Alt Method Test
------

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

# Links
Links test for a variety of options

[in line style for Google.com](google.com)
[in line style with title](google.com "Google's Homepage") This will display once mouse hoovers over link
[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text] The Reference is stated below. 

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

# Leaving Code chucks available
Inline `code` has `back ticks arond` it.
Can do blocks where you insert a code chunk
```
example code
```

# Tables
I will definitely use this and teach it.
Here is the code
```
Example of a Table
| Column 1      | Column 2      | Column 3  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------:|
| C2    is      | right-aligned |     $1600 |
| C3    is      | centered      |       $12 |
| note the dash | are neat      |        $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
no | need | to line it up
```

# Inserting a line test
Hopefully there is a break line
Hyphens
---
Asterisks
***
Underscore
___

#Bloack Quotes
This is pretty simple. Just use an arrow.

Without the arrow, things go back to the way they are.
No need to break the lines up. Things will automatically wrap.
>The long line where I ramble to test and make sure the text wraps with everything on a desktop and mobile device. *But* I am not **sure**.
