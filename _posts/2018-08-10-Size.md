Why we need to show measures of variability in the media.  

# Part II.

Referring back to variability and the substantive significance, the two-point difference between districts for TestX has more substantive significance than the 20-point difference for TestZ. This was a result of the variability of the different tests. In comparing the districts with TestX, District 2 would have 98% of their scores between 19 and 21 (the mean ± two times the standard deviation) while District 1 would have 98% of their scores between 21 and 23. Here, we have the top 1% of scores in District 2 overlapping with the bottom 1% of scores from District 1. In this case, there is a drastic difference in performance between the two districts and lends a high amount of substantive significance to the two-point difference. 

On the other hand, the increased variability in TestZ from above actually decreases the substantive significance for the 20-point difference. With a standard deviation of 80 for TestZ, we can expect that 98% of District 2 scores would be between 40 and 360. For District 1, we expect that 98% of the scores to between 60 and 380. For TestY, we now have the top 93% of District 2 overlapping with the bottom 93% of District 1. As one can easily tell at this point, there is considerable overlap between the two districts and the 20-point difference now has little substantive value.

We can also use the SD as a way of determing percentile ranks. However, the transferring of SD to standardized scores does not change the distribution, and using standardized scores to get percentile ranks assume a normal distribution. So this is why I think it can be even easier to report SDs and a lay-person with no experience in Statistics can understand what is going on. 

## Show Pictures

Instead of going through the explanation above about the substantive differences between the two districts, just show the below pictures.

Here is the faceted distributions for TestX:

As you can see, there is very little overlap between the two Districts. 

Here is the faceted distributions for TestZ:
![TestZ-D](../images/TestZ-D.PNG "TestZ")

Evidence here shows that even though there is a 20 point difference between the two districts, there is still considerable overlap.

Similarly, when other trivial things are being reported, like batting averages, show the distribution and highlight where the player falls. Then people would know if that .010 difference over the league average is impressive or not. 

Player Comparison to league:
![Ozzie](../images/Ozzie.png "Ozzie Albies")

Ozzie Albies from the ATL Braves is probably my favorite player in the league as of now. I like his style of play and approach to the game. Also, he hussles so much that he loses his helmet more often than not. However, despite hitting above the league average, the verticle line added shows he is not far from the average. 

I would also like to thank [FanGraphs](fangraphs.com) for doing what they do. If you are at all interested in just obtaining some data or what to learn about Sabermetrics, check them out.

## In Sum

Everything I just outlined in the first section is consicely displayed via the above images. Pictures really are worth a 1000 words, and if we can succiently showcase the importance of SD with images that take less than two minutes to generate, why don't we. I could spend a lot of time (and probably will in a later post) about statistical verse substantive significance, but that can easily be seen and understood utlizing these simple images. So instead of treating everyone as ignorant because we do not have the time to teach them inferential statistics, let's treat people like the intelligent person they are and give them as much information as possible.

I will continue to tweet various networks to provide more information, especially about variability when I see them. I encourage you to do the same. 

Cheers,
