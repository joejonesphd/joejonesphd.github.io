Be sure to check out [Part I](https://josephjonesphd.com/Variability1/) first. 

Referring back to variability and the substantive significance, the two-point difference between districts for TestX has more substantive significance than the 20-point difference for TestZ. This was a result of the variability of the different tests. 

In comparing the districts with TestX, District 2 would have 98% of their scores between 19 and 21 (the mean ± two times the standard deviation). District 1 has 98% of their scores between 21 and 23. Here, we have the top 1% of scores in District 2 overlapping with the bottom 1% of scores from District 1. In this case, there is a drastic difference in performance between the two districts and lends a high amount of substantive significance to the two-point difference.
