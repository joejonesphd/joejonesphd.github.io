These projects will take you to my [Github page](https://github.com/joejonesphd) where data files and material for the project are available. These are mostly tutorials for running analyses in R and SPSS.

### [Simple t-test with R/SPSS on batting data](https://github.com/joejonesphd/t-_test_example) 

This project will take you to a file with an Excel file containing batting averages for eligible players in the MLB. The file is sorted by American and National League Players. There will also be code for conducting the test in R and an SPSS syntax file, both with Annotations.
