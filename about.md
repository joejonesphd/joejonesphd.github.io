I am originally from Chattanooga, TN. I received my Bachelors and Masters from the University of TN-Chattanooga in Psychology. I am a doctoral candidate at Utah State University in the Experimental and Applied Psychological Science (EAPS) program with an emphasis on [Quantitative Psychology](http://psychology.usu.edu/quantitative-psychology/index){:target="_blank"}. I work with Thomas Ledermann as my chair and other incredible mentors. 

I have experience with a broad scope of analytic techniques, including multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, and mixture modeling. I have experience using these analytic techniques in SPSS, Mplus, and R. As an academic, I have two research outlets, quantitative and substantive work. My quantitative work addresses how various study and data characteristics affect performance in longitudinal analyses. For instance, the metric used for modeling time can greatly alter convergence rates and possible bias in parameter estimates depending on study design. The goal for this work is to detail the benefits and limitations to certain longitudinal analyses when applied to common study designs. In addition, this work will also help applied researchers design studies that will best address the longitudinal analyses needed to address their research questions.

My substantive interests are in developmental psychology with a focus on how cognition and health change over time. Recently, I began working on data-sets with older adults (65+ years) assessing the relationship between rates of change on several aspects of physical and mental health. When available, I will post links to my published articles below. 

However, I am an applied Quantitative Scientist/Analyst and use my statistical skills to address questions across a variety of outlets. I have a passion for analyzing data and try to incorporate it into my life and hobbies as much as possible. Be sure to check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/joejonesphd){:target="_blank"} for projects and analytic/coding tutorials (coming soon).

As a consultant, I have been privileged to work with amazing individuals across many fields. I have used my expertise to help people in Sports, Education, Neuroscience, Engineering, Religious Studies, Child Development, Law, and Market Research to name a few. The consulting work is not just limited to design and analyses, but across the entire process including interpretations and dissemination. My consulting services also assist in the writing reports and manuscripts as well as generating graphical displays. 

I also work as a Senior Research Associate with David Ross at his [Trial Consulting Firm](http://rosstrialconsulting.com/){:target="blank"}. We have worked on many cases together, but none is more memorable than helping Anthony Williams get out of prison. At 14 years old, Anthony was sentenced to life without parole for murder. 20 years later, Jennifer Bukowsky took a resentencing case where she would later advocate for Anthony's innocence. She contacted Dr. Ross who recruited myself and Dominick Atkinson to spend hundreds of hours combing through material. The amazing work by Jennifer and David's testimony eventually led to a judge ordering for Anthony's release.
