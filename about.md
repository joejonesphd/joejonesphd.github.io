I am originally from Chattanooga, TN. I received my Bachelors and Masters from the University of TN-Chattanooga in Psychology. I am a doctoral candidate in the Experimental and Applied Psychological Science (EAPS) program with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology at Utah State University. I work with Thomas Ledermann as my chair and other incredible mentors. I have experience with a broad scope of analytic techniques, including multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, and mixture modeling. In addition, I have experience using these analytic techniques in SPSS, Mplus, and R. My substantive interests are in developmental psychology with a focus on how cognition and health, both mental and physical, change over time. Recently, I began working on data-sets with older adults (65+ years) assessing the relationship between rates of change on several aspects of physical and mental health. 

However, I am an applied Quantitative Scientist/Analyst and use my statisitcal skills to address questions across a variety of outlets. I have a passion for analyzing data and try to incorporate it into my life and hobbies as much as possible.
