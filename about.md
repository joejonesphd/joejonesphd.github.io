I am a doctoral candidate at Utah State University in the [Quantitative Psychology Program](http://psychology.usu.edu/quantitative-psychology/index){:target="blank"}. I work with Thomas Ledermann as my chair and other incredible mentors. 

I live in Syracuse, NY working as a Statistician for [KS&R](http://www.ksrinc.com){:target="blank"}. I design and analyze research studies by utilizing many advanced techniques across a wide range of research engagements. I have experience with a broad scope of analytic techniques experience and use them in SPSS, Mplus, R, SAS, and various other statistical programs. My dissertation focuses on how various study and data characteristics influence performance of growth curve modeling. My research interests are in longitudinal data analyses, latent class analyses, and missing data techniques. I apply my statistical knowledge and experience across a variety of outlets including marketing sciences, developmental health (cognitive, physical, and mental) in older adults, education, relationship dynamics, and baseball.  

I am an applied Quantitative Scientist/Analyst and use my statistical skills to address questions across a variety of outlets. I have experience with a broad scope of analytic techniques, including multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, mixture modeling, and choice analyses. As a quantitative scientist, I address how various study and data characteristics affect performance in analytic techniques. The goal for this work is to detail the benefits and limitations to certain analytic techniques when applied to common study designs. This work helps researchers design studies that will best and most efficiently address their research questions.

My profession allows me to work with amazing individuals across many fields. I have used my expertise to help people in Sports, Education, Neuroscience, Engineering, Religious Studies, Child Development, Law, and Market Research to name a few. As a result, I have been a part of many amazing projects. However, none of them are more memorable than work I did as a Senior Research Associate with David Ross at his [Trial Consulting Firm](http://rosstrialconsulting.com/){:target="blank"}. On a pro-bono project, we helped get Anthony Williams get out of prison. At 14 years old, Anthony was sentenced to life without parole for murder. ***Twenty*** years later, Jennifer Bukowsky took a resentencing case where she would later advocate for Anthony's innocence. She contacted Dr. Ross who recruited Dominick Atkinson and myself to spend hundreds of hours combing through material. The amazing work by Jennifer and David's testimony eventually led to a judge ordering for Anthony's release.

I have a passion for analyzing data and try to incorporate it into my life and hobbies as much as possible. Be sure to check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/joejonesphd){:target="blank"} for projects and analytic/coding tutorials (coming soon). When not working, I enjoy getting outdoors, woodworking, watching baseball, video games, and spending time with my son.
