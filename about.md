I am originally from Chattanooga, TN. I received my Bachelors and Masters from the University of TN-Chattanooga in Psychology. I am in the Experimental and Applied Psychological Science (EAPS) program with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology at Utah State University. I started the program in the Fall of 2015 with Thomas Ledermann as my chair and other incredible mentors.  My research interests are in longitudinal data analyses, developmental, health, and sports psychology. I have experience with a broad scope of analytic techniques, including multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, and mixture modeling. In addition, I have experience using these analytic techniques in SPSS, Mplus, and R. My substantive interests are in developmental psychology with a focus on how cognition and health, both mental and physical, change over time. Recently, I began working on data-sets with older adults (65+ years) assessing the relationship between rates of change on several aspects of physical and mental health.
